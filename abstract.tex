Parsers have a long history in computer science.  This thesis proposes a novel framework for synthesizing efficient, verified parsers by refinement, and a demonstration of this framework by synthesizing a JavaScript parser competitive with existing open-source parsers.  The benefits of this framework may include more flexibility in the parsers that can be described, more control over the low-level details when necessary for performance, and automatic or mostly automatic correctness proofs.
