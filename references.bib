  abstract = { Software-based fault isolation (SFI), as used in Google's Native
	Client (NaCl), relies upon a conceptually simple machine-code analysis
	to enforce a security policy. But for complicated architectures such
	as the x86, it is all too easy to get the details of the analysis
	wrong. We have built a new checker that is smaller, faster, and has
	a much reduced trusted computing base when compared to Google's original
	analysis. The key to our approach is automatically generating the
	bulk of the analysis from a declarative description which we relate
	to a formal model of a subset of the x86 instruction architecture.
	The x86 model, developed in Coq, is of independent interest and should
	be usable for a wide range of machine-level verification tasks. },
