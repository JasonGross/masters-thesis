\todo{Fill in acknowledgements in cover.tex}

\todo{Move related work to end, so it flows better as explaining various other ways of parsing?  Or introduce CFGs earlier.}

\todo{Fill in related work with detailed explanations of various ways of writing parsers}

\todo{Splitter now returns numbers, not strings}

\todo{Explain how soundness can be done without parser extensionality, at the cost of algorithmic complexity elsewhere.}

\todo{Find a citation for Fiat, test with~\cite{fiat}}

\todo{(Optional) Section on showing that parser has "reasonable" performance on grammars with non-brute-force splitter (by using arrays and native strings)}

\todo{(Really Optional) Section on building parse trees, not just recognizers)}

\todoask{Should I include an appendix of all of the code of Fiat and parsers that is used, rendered verbatim?}
